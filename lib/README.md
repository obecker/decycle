The **Decycle Lib** is the engine behind the plugin. Checkout the 
[Configuration class](src/main/java/de/obqo/decycle/configuration/Configuration.java)
for the main API entry point, if you want to use the Decycle features outside
of the current published plugin.

**Note:** the API is not stable and might change between releases.
