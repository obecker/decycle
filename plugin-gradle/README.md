![decycle](../readme/logo-gradle-plugin.svg?raw=true)

The **Decycle Gradle Plugin** adds verification tasks to the Gradle build that check for package and slice cycles 
on the sources of the Gradle project.

## Installation

Add the plugin to your build gradle file as described on the 
[Plugin page](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/de.obqo.decycle).

## Running

The plugin creates for each source set a corresponding <code>decycle<i>SourceSetName</i></code> task.
Additionally there is one `decycle` task that runs all these source set specific tasks.

You can run a single decycle check (for example for the `main` source set) with

```
gradle decycleMain
```

You can run all decycle checks with

```
gradle decycle
```

The `decycle` task has a dependency on the `check` task, so it will be executed together with other verification tasks if you run

```
gradle check
```

## Configuration

The plugin adds a `decycle` configuration object to the build, that offers the following optional configuration settings:

<pre>
<b>decycle</b> {
    <b>sourceSets</b> sourceSets.main, sourceSets.test, ...
    <b>including</b> 'org.example.includes.**', ...
    <b>excluding</b> 'org.example.excludes.**', ...
    <b>ignore</b> from: 'org.examples.from.Example', to: 'org.examples.to.**'
    <b>slicings</b> {
        <i>name1</i> {
            <b>patterns</b> 'org.example.(*).**', ...
            <b>allow</b> 'a', 'b', ...
            <b>allowDirect</b> 'x', 'y', ...
        }
        <i>name2</i> {
            ...
        }
    }
}
</pre>

(_Note_: technically all configuration settings are method calls and no property assignments.
So you have to use `sourceSets ...` or even `sourceSets(...)` instead of `sourceSets = ...`.
Also, when the settings for `sourceSets`, `including`, `excluding`, and `ignore` are applied multiple times,
they will be added to the existing configuration.)

* `sourceSets`
  defines the source sets that should be analyzed.
  By default all source sets defined in the gradle build file are considered.
  That means this option is most useful if you only want a subset of the source sets to be checked.

* `including`
  defines ant style string patterns for the classes that should be included (default: all).
  It is recommended to configure an include pattern for your base package (e.g. `com.company.project.**`),
  otherwise the report will also contain all dependencies to JDK and external packages.

* `excluding`
  defines ant style string patterns for the classes that should be excluded (default: none)

* `ignore`
  defines a dependency (or an ant style string pattern for a set of dependencies) that should be ignored
  when checking cycle (and other) constraints on the analyzed classes (default none).
  This setting differs from `excluding` as the ignored dependency is not excluded from the dependency graph
  (i.e. it is present in the report). Multiple ignored dependencies can be configured by using `ignore` multiple times. 
  Ignored dependencies might be useful if you introduce decycle to an existing project and don't want to resolve all 
  existing cyclic dependencies at once.
  Technically the parameter for `ignore` is a map with the following two keys,
  both are optional:
    * `from:` defines the source of the dependency (default: all)
    * `to`: defines the target of the dependency (default: all)

* `slicings`
  starts the slicings block, each slicing
  is defined by its name (also known as slicing type). A slicing configuration contains:
    * `patterns`
      a list containing unnamed patterns (String) or named patterns.
      A named pattern is defined using <code>namedPattern(<i>name</i>, <i>pattern</i>)</code>.
    * `allow`
      defines a simple constraint on the defined slices
    * `allowDirect`
      defines a strict constraint on the defined slices. As constraints (both simple and strict) you can use
        * a string (referencing the name of the pattern/slice)
        * <code>anyOf(<i>slice, ...</i>)</code>
        * <code>oneOf(<i>slice, ...</i>)</code>

For the time being, until I have created a complete documentation, please have a look at the 
orignal documentation for [degraph](http://riy.github.io/degraph/documentation.html) for understanding the concepts of
[slicings](http://riy.github.io/degraph/documentation.html#adding-slicings) and constraints on slices.
